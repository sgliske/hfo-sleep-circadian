# Overview
This respository contains code in support of the paper [insert link once published].

Note, the data files were too large (>100 MB) to include on github and are available upon request from S Gliske.

The analysis is broken down into three main steps:
## 1. 'getVigilance_epochs.m'
## 2. 'compute_cyclicity_rate.m'
## 3. 'plot_cyclicity_rate.m'
